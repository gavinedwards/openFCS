Hi Elaine,

I hope this email gets to you okay.  Mum wasn't too sure which email you us=
ed so I am sending to both!

I got the message on Saturday that Grandma left a gift for me to get someth=
ing to remember her by.  It was a bit of a shock as I wasn't expecting it, =
and I am really grateful.  Initial I thought I would put it into a savings =
account for Hiro, but Mum and Dad mentioned that I should get something.  I=
 am a bit torn, but I will figure something out. =20

Bernadette and I are going to be running a marathon next month (just typing=
 that scares me).  We are both raising money for charities, she is running =
for a pancreatic cancer organisation and I am fund raising for a suicide pr=
evention organisation.  I would like to donate some of the money towards th=
at, I am sure that Grandma would appreciate it going to a good cause.

Anyway, I really should be getting back to work.  I hope you and Si are doi=
ng well, and please say "hi!" to the family for me, I think about you all o=
ften!

Lots of love,

Gavin
